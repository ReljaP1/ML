# ML

Developed and optimized reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning, Monte Carlo) to solve the Frozen Lake environment.
Designed Decision Tree and Random Forest models for real estate price prediction.
Improved model performance through IQR-based outlier removal, integer encoding, and hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluated using MSE, MAE, and RMSE metrics and visualized performance through Matplotlib.
